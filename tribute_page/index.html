            Following original member Michael Bohn and Tyler Carter's departure
            from Woe, Is Me, the duo formed Issues with keyboardist Ben Ferris,
            bassist Cory Ferris, guitarist AJ Rebollo, and drummer Case
            Snedecor, subsequently signing to Rise Records. The Ferris brothers
            departed from the group prior to the release of the Black Diamonds
            EP, in 2012. Snedecor left the band in 2013 and was replaced by
            drummer Josh Manuel while Ben and Cory Ferris were replaced by
            keyboardist and disc jockey Tyler Acord and bassist Skyler Acord,
            respectively. The band released their self-titled debut studio album
            in 2014, which was praised for its DJ-based breakdowns and mixture
            of metalcore and electronica, charting at number-nine on the US
            Billboard 200. They released their remix album, Diamond Dreams, in
            November 2014. Their sophomore studio album, Headspace, was released
            in May 2016. Bohn announced his departure from the band on January
            4, 2018. The following year, the group released their third studio
            album, Beautiful Oblivion, on October 4, 2019.
